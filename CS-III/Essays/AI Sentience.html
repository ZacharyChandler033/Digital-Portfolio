      <b>AI Sentience</b>

      <p>Recently a development in AI technology has caused a bit of an upsurge in media. In San Francisco company called OpenAI created an AI that turns text descriptions into hyper-realistic images. In the grand scheme of things, this seems very little until you dive further into the rabbit hole called AI generation.</p>
      
      <p>Most AI's have set algorithms that are very complex which is how they make images and other forms of artwork. And what makes this development stand out is that it didn't just create one image it would create multiple images that would vary off of the text that was typed here. </p>
      
      <p>Here, for example, is one of the images that the AI called DALL-E 2 produced when clicking on "An astronaut ridding a horse in a photorealistic style" it will make something like the images below. DALL-E 2 makes artwork that takes emotions and for the artist to feel something when painting. And that is when people start to think</p> 

       <img src="../../assets/images/2.jpg" alt="Image 1 Made By DALL-E 2" class="centerIMG">


      <p>Even with, this great invention, engineers say that in the next 10 to 20 years sentient AI could be possible. However, if sentient AI or robots are possible it could dramatically improve the efficiencies of a company's workplace and can augment the work humans have to do. When AI is implemented in to the work place they can take over repetitive or even dangerous tasks, it frees up the work that humans have to do so they can focus on the work that they are more capable of doing.</p>
	
      <p>Ultimate, robots have the potential to enhance our lives. Not just by shouldering the burden of physically demanding or repetitive tasks like assembling a vehicle, they may be able to do things like improve healthcare, make transportation more efficient, and give us, as people, more freedom to pursue creative endeavors.</p>
