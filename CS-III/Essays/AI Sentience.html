      <b>AI Sentience</b>

      <p>Recently a development in AI technology has caused a bit of an upsurge in media. In San Francisco company called OpenAI created an AI that turns text descriptions into hyper-realistic images. In the grand scheme of things, this seems very little until you dive further into the rabbit hole called AI generation.</p>
      
      <p>Most AI has set very complex algorithms. As a result, this is why most generated images are different than other forms of artwork. The reason that makes this development stand out from others is that any art piece has emotions behind it. And for an AI, which is just a program, to create something out of just simple text is very impressive. Additionally, just an AI can create images based solely on text, but also the fact that it makes the images very realistic to the point which you question if they happened.</p>
      
      <p>Here, for example, is one of the images that the AI called DALL-E 2 produced when clicking on "An astronaut riding a horse in a photorealistic style" it will make something like the images below.</p>

       <img src="../../assets/images/2.jpg" alt="Image 1 Made By DALL-E 2" class="centerIMG">

      
      <p>Even with, this great invention, engineers say that in the next 10 to 20 years sentient AI could be possible. However, if sentient AI or robots are possible it could dramatically improve the efficiencies of a company's workplace and can augment the work humans have to do. When AI is implemented in to the work place they can take over repetitive or even dangerous tasks, it frees up the work that humans have to do so they can focus on the work that they are more capable of doing.</p>

      <p>One of the main arguments on how sentient AI would be the downfall of humanity is if sentient AI programs other robots or even AI. They could make it o that the new variant doesn't accept human commands/requests. It could be a scary and dangerous reality. However, that would imply that AI will develop things like greed and anger.</p>
      
      <p>Ultimate, robots have the potential to enhance our lives. Not just by shouldering the burden of physically demanding or repetitive tasks like assembling a vehicle, they may be able to do things like improve healthcare, make transportation more efficient, and give us, as people, more freedom to pursue creative endeavors.</p>
