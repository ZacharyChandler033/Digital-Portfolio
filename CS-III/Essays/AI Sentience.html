      <h2>Adressing What Sentience Is</h2>
      <p class="essay">Senttience, for this argument atleast will not mean the possession of self-awareness that humans have, nor the ability to truly feel heman emotions as well. Instead, it will be based off the abitlity to act and more importantly think like a human, and disredarding the consciousness and/or true emotions. The reason why i bring this up is that if we wanted robots to feel pain we would have to programe iit to feel the pain or emotions to begin with.</p>
      
       <h2 >Benefits & Estimated Time</h2>
      <p class="essay">Even with, this great invention, engineers say that in the next 10 to 20 years sentient AI could be possible. However, if sentient AI or robots are possible it could dramatically improve the efficiencies of a company's workplace and can augment the work humans have to do. When AI is implemented in to the work place they can take over repetitive or even dangerous tasks, it frees up the work that humans have to do so they can focus on the work that they are more capable of doing.</p>

      <h2 >Main Concerns About AI At Work</h2>
      <p class="essay">One of the more common concerns with Sentient AI is the loss of jobs. But people people forget about previous enventions for farmers, one of the more notable ones would be the creation of tractors. Before the tractor people used ox and a plow to plow thier fields which took a long period of time. But with the tractor it allowed farmers to do more with less work, and since less work was required less people were needed to get the same work done. Now if we say that the invention or creation of the tracter is snetient AI it is the same thing as the tractor.</p>

      <h2 >Cconclusion</h2>
      <p class="essay">In conclusion, sentient AI's potential benefits heavily out weigh the potential downfalls. Although counterclame s of a terminator-like uprising or a matrix robot take over, snetient AI holds nothing but great promise fo the for seeable future. Ultimate, robots have the potential to enhance our lives. Not just by shouldering the burden of physically demanding or repetitive tasks like assembling a vehicle, they may be able to do things like improve healthcare, make transportation more efficient, and give us, as people, more freedom to pursue creative endeavors.</p>
