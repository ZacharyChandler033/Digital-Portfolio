      <h2>Orginizational Bias</h2>
      <p class="essay">Out of all of the biases out there the bias that I feel would affect me the most would have to be organizational bias. Organizational bias is bias backed into the way things get done in your enterprise or line of work. I feel that this bias is more dominant than others because of my ADD (attention deficit disorder), I have always had a hard time focusing on certain topics. Even though I have had a hard time focusing I feel that I would not be very organized in some lines of work and get sidetracked very easily. Making video games I've made sure that I make a well-planned schedule/Gantt chart so I don't get sidetracked on something that isn't relevant. As a result of this bias, I not only need to overcome, it but double down going into this ISP.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Simplification Bias</h2>
      <p class="essay">The next type of bias that I feel would affect me during the ISP would have to be simplification bias. Simplification bias is the motivation for comprehending reality, and reflecting information processes, and is related to cognitive ability and cognitive styles. Ever since my first computer science class in the 10th grade I have always over-complicated my thinking process and made my code way longer and more drawn out than it had to be. And knowing my current ISP I will have to figure this bias out sooner rather than later.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <h2>Impatience & Unsureness Bias</h2>
      <p class="essay">These next two biases are tied together in the regard that they are very similar. While working with other people on a collective assignment there is always the uncertainty that they will do the work that they agreed on, or that they will procrastinate till the last minute and do their work right before it is due which throughs everyone else off. This type of bias I will have to make sure doesn't happen because if it does nothing will get done by the deadline that is set.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Miscommunication Bias</h2>
      <p class="essay">The final bias that would affect me during this ISP would have to be miscommunication which ultimately ties into the previous biases. I feel that a project that involves multiple people who cant see each other would have to involve some form of outside contact or communication with some social media platforms like Discord or Google Meet. Which would help group members stay connected and stay informed about certain topics throughout the project. </p>
