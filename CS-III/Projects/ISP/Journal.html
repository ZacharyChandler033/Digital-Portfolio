    <h2>(Software) Development Engineer:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Software developers are the main people who design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional. Some of the challenges that i expect for this role is the person who decides to choice this role would get over whelmed with all of the things that they have to get done for otrher people to get their pumped into the program.</p>

    <h2>QA Engineer:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>A QA engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before a product launch. These tests entail other tasks such as developing and running new tests and reporting their results to stakeholders, who will collaborate to fix program bugs or problems. Some of the main problems that I see from the QA side of things is waiting for the found bug to be fixed and trusting that the other coworkers will do the work that they signed up for.</p>

    <h2>Project Manager:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>A Project Manager is responsible for the planning, procurement, execution and completion of a project. The project manager is in charge of the entire project and handles everything involved, such as the project scope, managing the project team, as well as the resources assigned to the project. Some of the major challeges that I personally feel that this role will encounter is just stress over certain deadlines not being met and having to keep reminding people that they have to get done</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Product Manager:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>A product manager is the person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfill, articulates what success looks like for a product, and rallies a team to turn that vision into a reality. Some of the challenges that i can see with this role is that if someone isnt that very confident then this isnt the role for them and on top of that I feel that this roled takes alot of energy to make the team run properly and would have to be done by and enthosiastic person.</p>
