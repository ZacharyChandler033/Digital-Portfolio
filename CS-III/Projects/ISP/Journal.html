    <h2>(Software) Development Engineer:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Software developers are the main people who design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. They also help build software systems that power networks and devices and ensure that those systems remain functional. Some of the challenges that i expect for this role is the person who decides to choice this role would get over whelmed with all of the things that they have to get done for otrher people to get their pumped into the program.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>QA Engineer:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>A QA engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before a product launch. These tests entail other tasks such as developing and running new tests and reporting their results to stakeholders, who will collaborate to fix program bugs or problems. Some of the main problems that I see from the QA side of things is waiting for the found bug to be fixed and trusting that the other coworkers will do the work that they signed up for.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Project Manager:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>A Project Manager is responsible for the planning, procurement, execution and completion of a project. The project manager is in charge of the entire project and handles everything involved, such as the project scope, managing the project team, as well as the resources assigned to the project. Some of the major challeges that I personally feel that this role will encounter is just stress over certain deadlines not being met and having to keep reminding people that they have to get done</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Product Manager:</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>A product manager is the person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfill, articulates what success looks like for a product, and rallies a team to turn that vision into a reality. Some of the challenges that i can see with this role is that if someone isnt that very confident then this isnt the role for them and on top of that I feel that this roled takes alot of energy to make the team run properly and would have to be done by and enthosiastic person.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>I feel that some of the technical problems and or challenges that we will encounter during this ISP is Either GitHub not saving certain scenes within unity or people not understanding unity as a whole. Also seeing how this may be the thirst ISP or even game my coworkers might be pumping out I feel th at as someone who hass been in the Computer Science field longer I feel that it is my personall goal that I help iout the people where ever I can to better help make this project as smooth as possible.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>I personally feel that some of the scheduling problems and or challenges that we will encounter during this ISP will be very large seeing how I am in my last year of high school. On top of that, I decided to take some AP Courses I will be flooding with home work that I will have to complete along with the amount of work that I will have to contribute towards this new ISP project. Secondly the peopek that are in this ISP project are all in different periods that what I am in whihc will make it a lot harder to communicate what is needed to be done and what could wait later.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Interpersonal challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>I Feel that some of our Interpersonal problem and or challenges will more than likely come down to people not doing their work and or procrastinating their work till the last minute. Which in gerneral is very frustrating when it comes down to a group project seeing how if someone doesnt do their work it hold the other prople behind them because they can upload with out them rewriting all of their code. </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>I feel that some of our Technical problems and or challenges at this time is determining appropriate software tools to use. Not a person on the team has previous game development experience. Therefore, questions such as 'what tool to we use to make art assets' and 'what language do we code this in? Unity? Swift?' were, and continue to be, issues at the forefront of my mind as we progress through the brainstorming phase.</p>
    <h2>Scheduling Challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>I feel that some of our Scheduling problems and or challenges would have to be finding appropriate time to continue active work on behalf of the Operation is, and will continue to be, a challenge. While some progress has been made on overall map design and layouts, the structure remains incomplete, pending a list of puzzles that will inform much of the rest of the pre-development work. This list requires perusal and analysis of many reports, examples, and data presented to us.</p>
    <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Some of the interpersonal problems and or challenges this week would have to be that i have no connection with any of my group mates so I am illinformed about any information about the project or anything on the technical side so i cant help out at all in any form possible.</p>

    <h2>Technical Challenges & Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Some of the technical challenges and or problems was the huge change in weater brought some unexpppected power drops and I was unable to do certain ideas game wise because the power was going in and out so no actual progress was unable to be made </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Interpersonal Challenges</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Some of my interpersonal challenges for this week would have to be that our communication between groups/class periods is very lack luster and we havent communicated on anything for the project at all just rough outlines.</p>
    <h2>Special Achievements</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
