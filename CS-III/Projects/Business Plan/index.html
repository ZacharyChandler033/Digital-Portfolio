  <div class="boxtext">
    <h2 class="centerText">Identity</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I plan on making a souls like game with hopefully working ai that they player will fight for gold and they can use said gold to upgrade their characters stats to make them more powerful. Also there will be various mini-bosses and bosses that range in diffeulty the further you go on and each boss will add an new mechanic that the player will have to over come with trial and error.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2 class="centerText">Problem</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This will be very ard to code for somepeople who are just starting out in computer science. Because you will not only have to learn how Microsofts Visual Studios works but also lear c# for the main scripts that will allow the game to run we intend it run.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2 class="centerText">Solution</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The only way to fix this is to watch videos and do some independent tests that arent in the main GitHub repo.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="centerText">Target Market</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Whoever is interested in this subgenre of games.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="centerText">Competition</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Competition wise there will be some other groups that may have very similar ideas but in the grand scheme of things it really doesnt matter because we can add things into the game that isnt in mos other games in the subgenre.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="centerText">Revenue Stream</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>There could be a tab in the menu where you can purchase cosmetics and other items that are for visual use only.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="centerText">Marketing Activities</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>There will be some sort of local leader board that is local and not in a web server.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="centerText">Expenses</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>There would be no expenses at all for the development of the game.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="centerText">Team And Key Roles</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>There will be 2 main groups of and within those groups there will be 1-2 roles.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><u>Team 1 <i>(AKA Blender Team)</i>:</u></b>
      <br>
      <br>
      This team will be the main part of the visuals and will have to learn how to work blenders features and how the navigation works. <i>(Some research will be required if new to blender and it is not recomended that people new to game development to take this team)</i>
      <br>
      
      <br>
      <b><u>Team 2 <i>(AKA UNITY Team)</i>:</u></b>
      <br>
      <br>
      This team will be the main reason how the game works and certain game mechanics work, and will have too learn how build pro and other unity tools work. <i>(Alot of research will be required to be in this team but most of the problems that you encounter can easily be googled and fixed. On that people will have to learn how to write proper c# scripts and be able to write useful comment about certain fuiunctiuons and certain variables that play a huge role in certain game mechanics.)</i>
