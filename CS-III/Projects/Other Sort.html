    <p><b>Difference</b></p>
    <p> The main difference between the sorts is their sorting algerithm. For example bubble sort checks and swaps elements i they are not greater in the asending order but it doesnt seek out the lowest number like the other two. Same can be said about insertion sort it's algorithm is very simple on the regards that it sorts the same way someone would when sorting a deck of cards it finds the lowest numerical value and <b><i>inserts</i></b> it i between the next lowest and the next highest based off the lowest number. Finally Selection sort is on of the mre complicated sorting algorithems in this text but its algorithm sorts and array by repeatedly finding the minimum element, in ascending order, from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.</p>
