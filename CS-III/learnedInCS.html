	Last year in Computer Science II I furtered my understanding on generation work like Lindenmeyr Ststem, commonly reffered to as L-systems. I also learned a new game engine to me called unity and that involved me to also learn Blender, which is a animation softwear. On top of that I had to learn C# to write code for my game.
