Hey there, I am Zachary Chandler, a student who is currently attending Allen High school in my senior year and currently taking Advanced Computer Science III. Ever since I could remember, I was always fascinated by the creation of video games. Not just the code that makes the game properly work but also the careful planning on how the story ties into the environment. Throughout my childhood, I attempted to make a properly working game that would be enjoyable to other people. I've made games from the generic first-person shooter to a fast-paced parkour game that involved a physics engine and a soundtrack to go along with the gameplay. Once I get an idea for a game concept I lose track of time thinking about the little things like animations to game mechanics. The one thing that I struggle with when I get near the game is how I should design the environment to work with the story.
