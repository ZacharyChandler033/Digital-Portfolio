    <b>Fingerprints!</b>

    <p>If you look at any website you will see that it starts with "https:" have you ever wondered what the "s" stands for? Well it stands for secure and the two primary purposes of a "secure" HTTP connection are to provide a secure and encrypted connection between a user and a remote web server. When this was reliced to the public there was something that followed soon after. Called a HTTPS Proxy Appliance which is a device that circumvents basic assumptions and guarantees Internet browser privacy and security. Allowing private institutions, like schools, corporations, and other organizations, to perform encryption and decryption between the client and server, without either of them being able to detect the proxy's presence.</p>

   <p>With HTTPS/SSL Proxy's being around common people also figured out how to get information from client and server with out being detected. When this happens people refer to it as a Man-In-The-Middle, also known as MITM, the attack is when a person/attacker intercepts a form of communication between two parties. These attackers use MITM attacks to steal login or personal information the m ost common instance of a MITM attack would be a fake web site that would steal peoples info thinking its the real one.</p>

    <p>To prevent/reduce peoples info from being stollen people started to implemment hashs. Hashs, commonly known as cryptographic hashes, are complex mathematical algorithms that carefully process every single bit of what they "digest." The reason whythey are really good is because they have a built in property that <u>if even <b>one bit</b> inside the certificate is changed</u>, an average of <u><b>half</b></u> of the fingerprint's hash bits will change in response. In simpler terms, if a cryptographic hash is used to "fingerprint" <b>any change</b>, no matter how small will result in a <b>completely different</b> fingerprint.</p>

    <p>With most logins requiring a digital fingerprint they had to have a applictaion to issue out these, "digital fingerprints". Thats where certificate authority, also known as CA, is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates to authenticate content sent from web servers. CA plays a major role is to make the internet a safe and secure place for everyday users to major organizations. </p>

    <p>With SSL Proxy Appliance, they can create a <b>fraudulent</b> "spoofed" web server certificate in order to <b>impersonate</b> the intended remote website, on top of that it signs that fraudulent certificate <b>itself</b> using the signature of the also-fraudulent Certificate Authority that was previously planted inside the user's browser or computer. This is commonly reffered to as "SSL Interception" and it can not be prevented. However, SSL Interceptiion can be reliably detected because it is very hard for someone to spoof a security certificate. With this there arre tow things that could happen if a threat does slip through detection this is called a false negative. And if an issue with the code that doesn't exist in the code this is a false positive.</p>

    <p>With all of the information gathered in article I feel liek that the government/shcool does have every right to eavesdrop on my communications if they think I am a threat to a group of people or I have intentions of hurting someone. If not then they don't have any right to go through my communication without asking for approval.</p>
