    <b>Projects That I Have Completed(ish) & Future Ones!!!</b>

    <div class="boxtext">
      <p>Last year a team and I made a game that was heavly based around fast paced parkour and fighting. With the limited time constrant that we were put against and litle to no previous knowledge on how unity worked we divided up the work load. In the end we had made a half compete game that had "<i><b>working</i></b>" physics engine, along with animations with sound effects. We also made a main theme/sound track for it in the end.</p>

      <p>For our team I personally feel like our main motivation to create the game and push through all the challanges that accured was a few simple motives. One of the bigger ones being just to have fun while doing something you love doing. The second one was kind of an obvious motive which was to show off what we did to our peers, and to share cool litle trick that we learned to make the game feel a bit more polished.</p>

      <p>Down bellow is some images of our code for various item thoughout our game.</p>

	<br>
	<p2>The first image is the main movement script that is used for our game to explain it in simple terms it applys a set vector to the player moddle/camera. Another thing to note is the counterMovement function with riggidBodies they are very hard to control and have a hard time not falling over or falling on one side or the other due to them constintly having physics applied to them. Thus there has to be a counter movement which just applys a small vector in the opposite direction till it reaches zero for its current velocity.</p2>
      

      <p>With every project or idea there is a huge amount of trial and error that comes along with it... and our project was no exeption. Some of the errors we got we couldnt even fix if we tried. The most notible ones to point out was that if the player got enough speed after a wall run, if they came in contact with anything, they would faze through the object like it wasnt there. I feel like our biggest mistake was to make a game that needed a physics engine because for some high school students to mess along with vector to make the player move is very advanced for someone just starting out. Our second biggest bug/problem was GitHub itself. It could have easly been prevented if we made a GitHub repository, but we didnt make one till two weeks before it was due. As a result our main scripts didnt upload and people in the group couldn't clone it the way it was intended.</p>
